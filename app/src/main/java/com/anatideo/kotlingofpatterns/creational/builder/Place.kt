/**
 * This class represents a Builder which constructs complex objects by separating construction
 * and representation. As Effective Java points out, constructors or factory methods with too many
 * parameters become susceptible to bugs when parameters are accidentally swapped in clients.
 *
 * Kotlinâ€™s named parameters solve this problem in many cases because a Kotlin caller can specify
 * the name of every parameter, reducing the chance of misplacing one. However, since Java clients
 * cannot leverage named parameters, the builder pattern remains helpful when you have a large Java
 * codebase that must interact with shiny new Kotlin objects.
